# Bookie
Bookie was a booking system project that was implemented as part of a interview in the 2nd year of Bachelor's studies.
The Rules of the system were specified as such:
- The system is to be initialized for a specific period of time (Could be made perpetual I suppose)
- The value of the rooms were 100 for the weekends and 70 for the weekdays
- For special dates which could be input into the system, there could be special prices. The system can take in 
  multiple series of special dates. 
- The system can be queried for the dates
